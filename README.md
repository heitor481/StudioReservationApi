# StudioReservationApi
This is a small project that I am building to learn better .NET Core. The idea behind that, is to create a project where you can select a studio to play with your band, or just play by yourself.
So, it will have a list of all the studios available with the location, rooms to play, and their schedule. This is the backend part, but it will have a front end (I am thinking in react or angular, or both), and probably one android app written in kotlin.
